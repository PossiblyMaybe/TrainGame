## Introduction

This is the documentation for my train game I'm working on:
* A: So I don't forgot how it works
* B: If by some small chance someone finds this and wants to mess around with the code
  they can without having to read the entire thing

I'll try and keep it up to date, and as the project progesses this will
get more detailed and (hopefully) useful

### Legal Things

Assimp is used to import the game's .obj files, and im not entirely sure
how to include the entire assimp source in the source for the game, so I
decided to create a documentation for the game and include this as an 
attempt to avoid any sort of tiny chance that I get into legal trouble for
using assimp in this project and then making said project redistributable
under AGPL.

## Code

I nuked all the previous classes so I could just focus on getting rendering to work
and it's just causing me pain

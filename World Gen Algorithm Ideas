Things required of world
mountains
rivers
seas
lakes

Possible solution:
Use noise to generate a basic height map
Apply some algorithm to "smooth" said map
Designate different land formations based on steepness and height
designate biomes
use areas from high points to low points to generate rivers and lakes
clean



generate Perlin Noise height map based on a random seed
smooth via matrix convolution or other smoothing technique (possible gpu algorithm to speed things up??)

designate different areas by range of heights (such as low/mid/high or something)
find steepness of areas to determine gradient of terrain (make it discrete like an integer scale from 0 to 10 or something, 10 being sheer cliff, 0 being flat)

depending on gradient in an area, determine geography type (mountain, plateau, plain, etc) (not a clue how to do this)

create oceans based on height map
generate divers based on height map

using original seed Pick a line for the sun to travel, pick a strength for the sun.
Based on strength and line of the sun choose hot and cold areas for the world

Do current simulation based on temperature (not a clue)
Pick a direction for the prevailing wind, do some form of simulation to figure out how the wind will flow

Use windflow,river location/size and ocean currents to create a humidity map
Use windflow, humidity and temperature to create a climate map
using the climate map and geography map create a biome map.

Generate world based on biome map and the original random seed

3 things to store the world.
Store tiles
Store seed, store biome map.
Biome map essentially contains the locations and sizes of all the different biomes in the world, which is easier said than done all things considered
